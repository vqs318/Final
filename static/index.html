            <h3>Background:</h3>
            <h5>The Dataset</h5>
            <p>
                We decided to use the Reddit comment dataset for our final project because we were both reddit users
                and we knew it could provide a variety of data for visualization.
                We became interested in Markov Chains after coming across r/SubredditSimulator.
                Unlike normal subreddits, SubredditSimulator, a subreddit or subforum of redddit is generated by bots
                crawling the various subreddits and creating posts and comments using Markov Chains.
            </p>
            <h5>Markov Chains</h5>
            <p>
                Markov chains represent a sequence of possible events where the probability of the next event only
                depends on the state attained in the previous event. Reddit comments can be modelled as Markov chains as
                we can count the number of times a given word follows any previous word in reddit comments and then
                build this into a tree of comments.
            </p>
            <h5>Markov Chain States</h5>
            <p>
                States in a Markov chain don't necessarily have to be one word. Indeed, in this visualisation, each
                state consists
                of two words. This means that, when we show the words that are most likely to follow a given word (the
                child nodes),
                we are actually counting the number of times that this word has followed the previous <i>two</i> words.
                For example if we have a tree that reads 'the', 'guardian', 'has' while reading down the tree, and the
                occurence of 'has' is 3, that
                means that the two word sequence of 'the' 'guardian' has been followed by 'has' 3 times. The word 'has'
                could have followed 'guardian' many more times in different contexts. The visualisation below does not
                show the number of states in the model, however, but it is key in choosing the child nodes of any node in the tree.
            </p>
            <h3>The Project:</h3>
            <p>
                Our project uses comment data of a chosen subreddit to produce a tree structure that indicates
                which words are more likely to follow another word in a sentence.
                The first row of words is the top 10 most likely words to start a sentence within the specified
                subreddit,
                and the following words are the 10 most likely words to occur after that specific word, and so on.
                Hovering over a word will show the weight of the word which is the probability that that word will be
                used.
            </p>
