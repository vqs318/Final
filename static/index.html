        <h3>Reddit Comment Markov Chains</h3>
         <div class="col-md-12">
        <h3>Background:</h3>
        <p>
            We decided we wanted to use Reddit for our final project because it was something we both used and could provide a variety of data for visualization.  We became interested in Markov Chains after coming across r/SubredditSimulator.  The entire subreddit is generated by bots crawling the various subreddits and creating posts and comments based on Markov Chains.  Markov chains are a sequence of possible events where the probability of the next event only depends on the state attained in the previous event.  

        </p>
        <h3>The Project:</h3>
        <p>
            Our project uses the comments section of a chosen subreddit to produce a tree like structure that signifies which words are more likely to follow another word in a sentence.  The first row of words is the top 10 most likely words to start a sentence within the specified subreddit.  The following words are the 10 most likely words to occur after that specific word.  Hovering over a word will show the weight of the word which is the probability that that word will be used.  
        </p>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pick a subreddit from the dropdown list</li>
                <li>Press </li>
                <li>Click a word from the row presented</li>
                <li>Continue making branches by clicking words</li>
            </ul>
